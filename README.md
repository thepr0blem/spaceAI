## 1. Introduction 
### 1.1. General idea 

The main purpose of this exercise (beside the obvious, which is self-development) is to build a simple "space runner" game which will be an environment for genetic algorithm implementation.

### 1.2. Technologies used

```Arcade``` library

### 1.3. Project structure 

```
├── generation logs         # Top genes saved
├── images                  # Game graphics
├── main.py                 # main file (contains game class)
├── game_classes.py         # in-game objects (Spaceship, obstacles etc.) 
├── helper_functions.py     
├── settings.py             # Game and simulation settings
├── requirments.txt         # Required libraries
└── README.md                 
```

### 1.4. How to use 

Run ```main.py``` script. Required technologies are listed in ```requirments.txt``` file.
